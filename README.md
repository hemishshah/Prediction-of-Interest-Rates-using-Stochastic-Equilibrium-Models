# Interest Rate Modelling
This paper explores the development of a comprehensive
interest rate model by employing object-oriented programming
principles within Python. The model integrates multiple interest
rate components, emphasizing modularity, flexibility, and
maintainability, key aspects enabled by object-oriented design.
We aim to develop and deploy a user-friendly interface for
interacting with the model, enhancing accessibility for users
who may not be well-versed in programming. The research
focuses on single-factor short rate models, specifically the
Merton Model, Vasicek Model, and Normal Model [1], which
are pivotal in financial markets for the pricing of various
fixed-income securities and derivatives. Each model offers
unique insights into the dynamics of short-term interest rates,
influenced by different sources of risk. Through this project,
we document the implementation steps, from initial model
setup to optimization and deployment, illustrating the practical
applications and effectiveness of these models in predicting
interest rate movements. The paper also discusses the potential
for extending these methodologies to incorporate multi-factor
models, thereby broadening the scope and accuracy of interest
rate forecasting in complex financial environments.
