# Prediction-of-Interest-Rates-using-Stochastic-Equilibrium-Models
The project aims to create a comprehensive interest rate model using object-oriented programming in Python. It will incorporate various interest rate components, ensuring modularity, flexibility, and maintainability. Additionally, a user-friendly interface will be developed for deploying the model.
